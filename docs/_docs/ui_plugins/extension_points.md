# Extension points
An extension point essentially is a Cloud Director predefined global or contextual navigation/menu placeholder, 
which a UI plugin will use to attach itself to and be used for navigation/plugin initialization. 
There is a list of extension points, one can pick from.

## Available extension points
The available extension points are demonstrated in the [Showcase plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/development_examples/showcase_ui_plugin/)
