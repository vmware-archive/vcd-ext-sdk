# VCD Customize Portal Plugin

> **NOTE**: This plugin-lifecycle plugin has been deprecated. There is a new customize-portal project published in the [vmware-samples](https://github.com/vmware-samples/vcd-ext-samples/tree/customize-portal) repository that provides a similar experience. Additionally, this plugin has been included in VMware Cloud Director since version 9.7.
